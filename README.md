# PING_PONG
This is a ping pong game built using outstanding library of python named pygame.

This repository is a result of contribution from different members of the team CODEMAKERS. Here we have built ping pong game totally on the base of OOPS concept
and used pygame library for the designing of the game.
Modules like Moviepy, which is used for running the video (table tennis) during the loading of the programme. This module has vast amount of other methods for
doing crazy things with the videos like adding texts, transition and playing with other properties of the video.
Pickle module is used for dumping and loading the data from Scoreboard.dat file to manage Leaderboard.

Each team member has shown equal dedication and determination for the success of this project. From designing of the game to the concept build up to achieve the goal
is handled in colaboration.
